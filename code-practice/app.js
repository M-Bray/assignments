// Number of guesses is the same as the size of the list. 
// This is called linear time.

// Here are five Big O run times that you’ll encounter a lot, sorted from fastest to slowest:
// • O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
// • O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
// • O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort (coming up in chapter 4).
// • O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort (coming up in chapter 2).
// • O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson (coming up next!).
